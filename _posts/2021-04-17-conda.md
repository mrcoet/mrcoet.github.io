Welcome to this lesson on using Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python. With Anaconda, it's simple to install the packages you'll often use in data science work. You'll also use it to create virtual environments that make working on multiple projects much less mind-twisting. Anaconda has simplified my workflow and solved a lot of issues I had dealing with packages and multiple Python versions.
Anaconda is actually a distribution of software that comes with **conda**, Python, and over 150 scientific packages and their dependencies.

## Managing Packages

Package managers are used to installing libraries and other software on your computer. You’re probably already familiar with pip, it’s the default package manager for Python libraries. Conda is similar to pip except that the available packages are focused around data science while pip is for general use. However, conda is not Python-specific like pip is, it can also install non-Python packages. It is a package manager for any software stack. That being said, not all Python libraries are available from the Anaconda distribution and conda. You can (and will) still use pip alongside conda to install packages.  
Conda installs precompiled packages. For example, the Anaconda distribution comes with Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit-learn compiled with the MKL library, speeding up various math operations. The packages are maintained by contributors to the distribution which means they usually lag behind new releases. But because someone needed to build the packages for many systems, they tend to be more stable (and more convenient for you).

## Environments

Along with managing packages, Conda is also a virtual environment manager. It's similar to virtualenv and pyenv, other popular environment managers.  
Environments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects. Often you’ll be working with code that depends on different versions of some library. For example, you could have code that uses new features in Numpy, or code that uses old features that have been removed. It’s practically impossible to have two versions of Numpy installed at once. Instead, you should make an environment for each version of Numpy then work in the appropriate environment for the project.  
This issue also happens a lot when dealing with Python 2 and Python 3. You might be working with old code that doesn’t run in Python 3 and a new code that doesn’t run in Python 2. Having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. It’s much better to have separate environments.  
You can also export the list of packages in an environment to a file, then include that file with your code. This allows other people to easily load all the dependencies for your code. Pip has similar functionality with:  

```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt.
```

## Installing Anaconda

Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You can find the installers at [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).  
If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.  
Choose the Python 3.7 version, you can install Python 2 versions later. Also, choose the 64-bit installer if you have A 64-bit operating system, otherwise go with the 32-bit installer. Go ahead and choose the appropriate version, then install it. Continue on afterwards!  
After installation, you’re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed which you can see below. You can check out your own install by entering:  

```python
conda list
```

On Windows
A bunch of applications is installed along with Anaconda:

- **Anaconda Navigator**, a GUI for managing your environments and package
- **Anaconda Prompt**, a terminal where you can use the command-line interface to manage your environments and packages
- **Spyder**, an IDE geared toward scientific development

To avoid errors later, it's best to update all the packages in the default environment. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** application. In the prompt, run the following commands:  

```python
conda upgrade conda
conda upgrade --all
```

and answer yes when asked if you want to install the packages. The packages that come with the initial install tend to be out of date, so updating them now will prevent future errors from out of date software.

***Note:*** In the previous step, running ```conda upgrade conda``` should not be necessary because ```--all``` include the conda package itself, but some users have encountered errors without it.

In the rest of this lesson, I'll be asking you to use commands in your terminal. I highly suggest you start working with Anaconda this way, then later use the GUI if you'd like.

### Troubleshooting

If you are seeing the following "conda command not found" and are using ZShell, you have to do the following:

```shell
Add export PATH="/Users/username/anaconda/bin:$PATH" to your .zsh_config file.
```

## Managing packages

Once you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To install a package, type:

```python
conda install package_name
```
